    <h1>The British Museum Expendition</h1>
    <p>The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London, England, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely collected during the era of the British Empire. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. It was the first public national museum in the world.</p>
    <p>Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy, most notably in the case of the Elgin Marbles of Greece and the Rosetta Stone of Egypt.</p>
    <p>When clicking into the homepage of the website, you can first see the huge picture of the British Museum. Above this is the navigation bar, which is composed of Visit, Exhibitions and Events, Collection, Learn, Membership and Support us.</p>
    <p>The most important information about the exhibition and the date is just below the big title with the theme and the picture of the events. There are many menu bars under the navigation bar, you can perform more detailed operations such as Family Visit, Museum Map and Food and drink which makes it convenient for the visitors to find what they want without click into a lot of pages.</p>
